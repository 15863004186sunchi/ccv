<section><h1>DPM: Deformable Parts Model</h1>
<h2 id="whats-dpm">what’s DPM?</h2>

<p>The original paper refers to:
Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part-Based Models, Pedro F. Felzenszwalb, Ross B. Girshick, David McAllester and Deva Ramanan</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>

<p>That’s a long story. In very high level, DPM assumes an object is constructed by
its parts. Thus, the detector will first found a match of its whole, and then
using its part models to fine-tune the result. For details, please read the
paper. What I can show you, is how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>./dpmdetect &lt;Your Image contains Pedestrians&gt; ../samples/pedestrian.m | ./dpmdraw.rb &lt;Your Image contains Pedestrians&gt; output.png
</code></pre>

<p>Checkout output.png, see what happens?</p>

<h2 id="what-about-performance">What about performance?</h2>

<p>DPM is not known for its speed. Its ability to identify difficult objects, is
the selling point. However, this implementation tries to optimize for speed as
well. For a 640x480 photo, this implementation will be done in about one second,
without multi-thread support.</p>

<p>Accuracy-wise:</p>

<p>There are two off-the-shelf implementations. One is the DPM in matlab from author,
the other is HOG detector from OpenCV. Fo the task to detect pedestrians in a
given image, we use INTRA 2008 dataset, and it provides both training and testing
data. With OpenCV stock peopledetect sample program, we get:</p>

<pre><code>65.7% (156)
</code></pre>

<p>The former one is the detection rate (how many objects have been detected), the
later is the number of false alarms (the detected region doesn’t contain the
expected object)</p>

<p>Our implementation?</p>

<pre><code>80.14% (74)
</code></pre>

<p>Looks pretty good!</p>

<p>Speed-wise:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-train-my-own-detector">How to train my own detector?</h2>

<p>Yes, this implementation comes with a tool to train your own detector too.</p>

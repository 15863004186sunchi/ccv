<section><h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Around 2010, when Lian and I was working on our gesture recognition demo, out
of the frustration to abstract redundant image preprocessing operations into a
set of clean and concise functions, I started to consider moving away from the
stack. Why? Well, after two years, ccv is the very answer.</p>
<h3>Cached Image Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Many computer vision tasks nowadays consist of quite a few preprocessing
layers: image pyramid generation, color space conversion etc. These potentially
redundant operations cannot be easily eliminated within a mature API. ccv
provides a built-in cache mechanism that, while maintains a clean function
interface, effectively does transparent cache for you. <a href="/lib/ccv-memory/">
- How?</a></p>
<h3>Easy to Embed</h3>
<p>While it depends on quite a few libraries for the best performance and complete
feature, ccv's majority functionalities will still work without these libraries.
You can even drop the ccv source code into your project, and it will work!</p>
<h3>Modern Computer Vision Algorithms</h3>
<p>One core concept of ccv development is "application driven". As a result, ccv
end up implementing a handful state-of-art algorithms. It includes a fast
detection algorithm for rigid object (face etc.), an accurate object detection
algorithm for somewhat difficult object (pedestrian, cat etc.), a state-of-art
text detection algorithm, and the long-standing feature point detection algorithm.</p>

<section><h2>Call for a new, lightweight, c-based computer vision library</h2>
<p>February 6th, 2010</p>
<p>Since 2005, most of my computer vision work were done with OpenCV. It is an amazingly hand-optimized piece of software. A large number of modern applications are based on OpenCV framework. It is a useful toolset. However, for all this years, I finally feel the need to make a more lightweight, pure-c/function based library. There are some ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It should be fast. There is no need to build a toolset that is slow. Former work such as lapack and gsl are a better choices rather than reinvent the wheel. For the same reason, It is necessary to fork basic routines from OpenCV, such as Canny detector, kalman filter, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Better memory management, cache everything. OpenCV partially implemented a memory management routine, but failed to have a cache mechanism, partly because there are too many functions and it hard to break in and add another layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Less but more about modern algorithms. Implementing a fewer but niche algorithms and give intuitive examples. Keep compatibility with OpenCV (through interpreting functions).</p></li>
<li><p>Give some love to distributed system, and modern compilers (LLVM &amp; Clang).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am aware of that many vision works are never made the way to mass (VLFeat for example), but that's the plan.</p>
